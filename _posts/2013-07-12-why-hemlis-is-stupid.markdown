<p>Today I stumbled across <a title="Heml.is website" href="http://heml.is" target="_blank">heml.is</a>. This is a supposed to become a crowdfunded, secure (as in NSA-free) replacement for WhatsApp and iMessage after the recent PRISM scares.</p>
<p>I think backing heml.is is a stupid idea.</p>
<p>I came across some forum posts about how this all is new and marvellous, so I felt I needed to burst some bubbles.</p>
<p>It <strong>has</strong> been done before. See the wonderful site <a href="https://prism-break.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://prism-break.org/</a>.</p>

Love the way how it looks too <img alt="" src="https://what.cd/static/common/smileys/smile.gif" border="0" /></p></blockquote>
<p>That site states they are not going to stick to design guidelines and basically launch an ios app on all platforms. We've seen that before, and it pretty much has been a <strong>fucking disaster</strong> every time. Design guidelines exist for a reason, and that is to make users feel comfortable and not confuse the heck out of them. It's part of the ecosystem, and ecosystems have rules.</p>

The guys making this are the same guys who created Flattr!</p></blockquote>
<p>So tying in to my previous point: it'll probably a disaster usability-wise.</p>
<p>Maybe I should send these guys some books on interaction design. Usability matters a LOT, because if users are frustrated, they drop your app. If they drop the app, noone wil use it, if noone uses it, it is useless.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>heml.is</strong> pretty much wrote (paraphrased):<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">...the platform won't be open source </span></p></blockquote>
<p>Instant fail. <a title="George Lawton: Open Source Security: Opportunity or Oxymoron" href="http://see.xidian.edu.cn/hujianwei/papers/058-Open%20source%20security.pdf" target="_blank">Applications are in fact safer if they are open source.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>heml.is</strong> wrote:<br />
<strong>Your server only?</strong><br />
Yes! The way to make the system secure is that we can control the infrastructure. Distributing to other servers makes it impossible to give any guarantees about the security. We’ll have audits from trusted third parties on our platforms regularily, in cooperation with our community.</p></blockquote>
<p>False. There are plenty of ways to make the system secure <strong>while not trusting heml.is</strong>. There are plenty mature solutions for this, for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">assymetric crypto</a>.</p>
<p>So BRB starting a campaign for an <strong>actually safe app</strong> and raising 100k.</p>
