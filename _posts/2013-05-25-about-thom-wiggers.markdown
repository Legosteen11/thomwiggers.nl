<p>I am a student at <a title="Radboud University Website" href="http://www.ru.nl/" target="_blank">Radboud University Nijmegen</a>, studying both Computer Sciences and Information Sciences. I am pretty interested in the security aspects of computing, but also in the business applications of information technology.</p>
<p>Currently I am a web developer for <a href="http://inqbator.nl" target="_blank">InQbator B.V.</a>. For them, I am working on a <a href="http://django-project.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Django</a> webapplication. I've also been a teaching assistent at Radboud University for the undergraduate Functional Programming course, teaching students how to program in Haskell and <a href="http://clean.cs.ru.nl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Clean</a> (I like Haskell better).</p>
<p>In my spare time I'm currently involved with <a href="http://ictnetwerknijmegen.nl">ICT Netwerk Nijmegen</a>. I've also been on the board of <a href="http://www.thalia.nu">Studievereniging Thalia</a> and still a part of various committees. I also occasionally contribute to various open-source projects, mostly when I run into something and have to fix it for myself. See also <a href="http://github.com/thomwiggers">my Github profile</a>. I also have a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/248065/thom-wiggers">profile on Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find me on <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thomwiggers/en" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thomwiggers">Twitter</a>.</p>
