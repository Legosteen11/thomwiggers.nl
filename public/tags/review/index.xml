It is a bit like the classic
dystopian novel 1984 being brought up to date in the age of smartphones, apps
and Google, Facebook and Twitter. Though it does not have very novel ideas,
Eggers paints a picture of the tyranny of the masses and of the consequences of
a society that only has a surface level.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I decided it was time to behave myself a bit like the pretentious hipster I secretly am and post a bit about the music that I discovered lately.
London Grammar - If You Wait (2013) London Grammar are an UK based indie pop band. They released their debut album If You Wait a couple of weeks ago. Pitchfork already wrote a great review about them, so I&#39;m not going to repeat that, but I&#39;d like to highlight their great cover of Kavinsky&#39;s Nightcall, capturing the feeling of the original track so nicely.</description></item></channel></rss>
