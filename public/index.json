I optimised Prøst for the ARM11 microprocessor architecture. By trying to find a provably minimal program for one of the sub-operations, I found a new approach to implementing MixSlices, one of the sub-operations in Prøst's permute function. This new implementation has 33% fewer arithmetic operations than the original version. Using this result and by implementing Prøst in assembly and applying micro-optimisations, a performance gain of 28% to 48% was achieved.","tags":[],"title":"Implementing CAESAR candidate Prøst on ARM11","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thom Wiggers"],"categories":null,"content":"See the project page for more information.\n","date":1428624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1428624000,"objectID":"831c968e98d7b4762c75d083cd5364de","permalink":"/publication/bachelors-thesis/","publishdate":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bachelors-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"My abstract","tags":null,"title":"Implementing Prøst on ARM11","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This page lists the products of my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s thesis research.\nPrøst Prøst is an authenticated encryption cipher and a contestant in the CAESAR competition for Authenticated Encryption.
