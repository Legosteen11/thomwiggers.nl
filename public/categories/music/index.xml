      <description>It&#39;s been a while since I posted. Today I decided it was time to behave myself a bit like the pretentious hipster I secretly am and post a bit about the music that I discovered lately.
 London Grammar - If You Wait (2013)  London Grammar are an UK based indie pop band. They released their debut album If You Wait a couple of weeks ago. Pitchfork already wrote a great review about them, so I&#39;m not going to repeat that, but I&#39;d like to highlight their great cover of Kavinsky&#39;s Nightcall, capturing the feeling of the original track so nicely.</description>
