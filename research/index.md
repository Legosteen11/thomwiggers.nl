# Research

## Cryptographic software

### Prøst on ARM11
Prøst is an authenticated encryption cipher and a contestant in the [CAESAR][caesar] competition for Authenticated Encryption.
For my bachelor thesis research project, I've implemented Prøst on ARM11. This work also resulted in a paper published with the
[Student Research Conference 2015][src]. [More can be found here.][proestpage]


### PRIDE in Python

I've implemented [PRIDE][pridepaper] in Python. This implementation can be found [on Github][pride-python].
