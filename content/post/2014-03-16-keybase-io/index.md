<p>Users of PGP will be aware of the many keyservers around the web. <a
href="http://keybase.io" target="_blank">Keybase.io</a> has launched as an
interesting alternative to the 'boring' and complicated keyservers. They provide
an easy CLI client and web client (if you choose to share your private key
- I didn't) for PGP crypto, where you don't need to know someone's key id - just
    their username on Twitter or GitHub.</p>

<p>One of the main problems I see with most crypto tools, like PGP, is usability. Without innovations I don't think it will ever reach the masses. I'll be paying attention to keybase and see how it develops.</p>
