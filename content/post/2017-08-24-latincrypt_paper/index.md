I'm going to Cuba as my submission to Latincrypt 2017 was accepted!
The paper is called *Energy-efficient ARM64 Cluster with Cryptanalytic Applications: 80 cores that do not cost you an ARM and a leg*.
Visit the [accompanying page to view the software][armcluster].
I'll upload the paper once I'm done editing.
