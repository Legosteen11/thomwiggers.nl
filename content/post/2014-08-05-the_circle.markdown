I recently read *The Circle* by Dave Eggers. It is a bit like the classic
dystopian novel 1984 being brought up to date in the age of smartphones, apps
and Google, Facebook and Twitter. Though it does not have very novel ideas,
Eggers paints a picture of the tyranny of the masses and of the consequences of
a society that only has a surface level.

Though the characters are pretty flat and lead character Mae quickly turns from
a smart girl with ideals into a one-dimensional surface that believes anything
that she is told, the story was pretty captivating and chilling. The ending
seemed pretty rushed, though, and after reading it it you just put your e-reader
aside. The lack of dissidence outside of Mercer also seems a bit unrealistic.

It was a good read, and although the book wasn't mindblowing at least I'll have
a new argument when people say that they've got nothing to hide.
