## Prøst

Prøst is an authenticated encryption cipher and a contestant in the CAESAR competition for Authenticated Encryption. For my bachelor thesis research project, I’ve implemented Prøst on ARM11.

## Software

* Prøst on ARM can be [found on Github here][proest-arm11].
* My demo implementation of Prøst in Python can be [found in this Github repository][proest-python].
* My implementation of the Shortest Straight Line program finder is also [available on Github][slpsat].
* My modified version of [qhasm][qhasm] is also [available on Github][qhasm-arm]. The no-stack version is available from the branch `nostack`.
* My implementation of Boyar's heuristic for finding shorter straight line programs [can be found here][slp-heuristic].
* My packaged version of `cpucycles4ns` can be found at [Github][cpucycles4ns].
