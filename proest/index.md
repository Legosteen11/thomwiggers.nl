# Prøst

Prøst is an authenticated encryption cipher and a contestant in the [CAESAR][caesar] competition for Authenticated Encryption.
For my bachelor thesis research project, I've implemented Prøst on ARM11.

## Thesis

My thesis was titled [todo][thesis]. The presentation can be [found here][presentation].

## Software

* Prøst on ARM can be [found on Github here][fixme]
* My implementation of the Shortest Straight Line program finder is also [available on github][fixme]
* My modified version of [qhasm][qhasm] is also [available on github][qhasm-arm]. The no-stack version is available from the branch `nostack`.
* My implementation of Boyar's heuristic for finding shorter straight line programs [can be found here][fixme].
* The LaTeX source code for the documents I've produced is [available here][fixme]
